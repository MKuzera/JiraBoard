# Jira Board 

### Goal of this project was to learn how to use gRPC framework with C# language.

The project is made up of **4 services** (the code for the Next.js client service is not located in this repository). Originally, there were only meant to be **3 services** (without the ASP.NET service), which would connect the gRPC service with the frontend client using RPC. However, this solution was not well-supported, and complications arose.

Since this project is for learning purposes, I decided to add an additional **ASP.NET service** to "convert" gRPC requests into HTTP requests for the client. This approach makes more sense because the **RPC protocol** is typically used for more complex scenarios (with a higher throughput of data) â€” such as streaming large amounts of data between two services.

#### gPRC Service (main component) - name: JiraBoardgRPC

This service uses **gRPC (Google Remote Procedure Call)** for efficient communication between distributed systems.

- Acts as the **main backend component** of the application.
- Implements a **gRPC server** exposing a set of remote procedures defined in `.proto` files.
- Supports **client-server communication** over HTTP/2 using **Protocol Buffers** for serialization.
- Follows modern architectural practices by utilizing **Dependency Injection** for service registration and component management.

#### ASP.NET Service (Second Main Component for HTTP Requests) - name: MiddleStepService

This service is built with **ASP.NET Core** and serves as the second main backend component, responsible for handling traditional **HTTP/REST requests**.

- Implements a **RESTful API** interface for clients that do not use gRPC.
- Allows for integration with browsers, frontend applications, or third-party services over standard **HTTP**.
- Complements the gRPC service by offering an alternative communication method, especially suitable for frontend and web-based clients.
- Internally, this service acts as a **gRPC client**, using the shared `.proto` file to communicate with the main gRPC backend.

#### Integration Tests Service - name: GrpcTests

This service is used to connect with both the **gRPC service** and the **ASP.NET service** to perform integration tests. It acts as a **gRPC client**, interacting with the backend services to simulate real-world scenarios and validate the system's behavior.

- Connects to the **gRPC service** to verify the correctness of remote procedures.
- Communicates with the **ASP.NET service** to test HTTP/REST endpoints.
- Ensures end-to-end functionality by simulating requests and validating responses across both services.
- Utilizes **XUnit** for unit and integration testing to ensure reliable and maintainable tests.
- Internally, this service acts as a gRPC client, using the shared .proto file to communicate with the main gRPC backend.

#### NEXT.JS Frontend Client

This is the **frontend client** built with **Next.js**, responsible for connecting with the **ASP.NET service** to interact with backend functionalities.

- **Connects to the ASP.NET service** via HTTP to make requests to the backend.
- Uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication, requiring users to log in before accessing certain features.
- Provides a **simple user interface** designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Code for this client service is not located in this repository.

**This project was developed as part of the Advanced Internet Technologies course and meets the requirements for using the following technologies:**

- **Microservices in C#:** The project is structured around a **microservices architecture**, where each component is independent, responsible for a specific part of the application. The services are written in **C#**, utilizing the .NET framework for building scalable and maintainable backend solutions.

- **gRPC:** The project employs **gRPC** (Google Remote Procedure Call) to facilitate fast, efficient communication between the backend services. By using **Protocol Buffers** for data serialization and **HTTP/2** for transport, gRPC ensures high performance, making it suitable for high-throughput and low-latency communication, especially between microservices.

- **ASP.NET (Web API):** The **ASP.NET Core Web API** is used to expose HTTP/RESTful endpoints for client communication. This allows integration with external clients, including browsers and frontend frameworks like **Next.js**. The ASP.NET API provides a bridge between the frontend and the backend, converting requests and responses into the appropriate formats.

- **Dependency Injection:** The project utilizes **Dependency Injection** (DI) for managing dependencies across services, including the **gRPC service**. By using DI in the gRPC service, dependencies like data repositories or logging services are injected into service classes at runtime, rather than being hardcoded. This approach improves testability, flexibility, and modularity by decoupling components. With DI, the gRPC service can easily evolve, as dependencies can be swapped or mocked for testing purposes, ensuring a cleaner and more maintainable codebase.

- **Next.js:** The frontend client is built using **Next.js**, a React-based framework for building server-side rendered (SSR) web applications. It provides an efficient way to build dynamic web interfaces with fast rendering times, as well as offering features like routing, static site generation (SSG), and API routes. Next.js helps create a seamless user experience, integrating smoothly with the backend services.

- **SOLID Principles:** The project adheres to the **SOLID** principles of object-oriented design to ensure code maintainability, scalability, and clarity:
    - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** Each service and class has one responsibility, making the codebase more modular and easier to test.
      - **Ex.** Every controller is responsible only for handling HTTP requests and returning responses. For example, a `JiraBoardController` handles only JiraBoard-related actions (e.g., creating, updating, deleting tasks on board), while a separate `UserAuthController` handles authentication tasks.
    
    - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** The design is open for extension but closed for modification, meaning new features can be added without altering existing code.
      - **Ex.** If a new feature is required, such as logging every request, a new logging service can be introduced without changing the existing controller logic.
    
    - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Derived classes can be substituted for their base classes without affecting the correctness of the application.
      - **Ex.** For now, there is no example in this project that directly demonstrates LSP. However, this principle will apply once we introduce inheritance and polymorphism. Derived classes should be able to replace base classes without causing errors or changing the expected behavior of the system.
    
    - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Services and classes only implement methods that they actually need, ensuring they are not bloated with unnecessary functionality.
      - **Ex.** No method in this project is unused. The classes and services are designed to implement only the methods they need, avoiding unnecessary dependencies and keeping the codebase lean. 

    - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces), not on concrete implementations, improving the flexibility and testability of the system.
      - **Ex.** Instead of directly instantiating a database service in a class, an interface like `IDatabaseService` is used. This allows the service to be easily swapped out (e.g., from an SQL database to a NoSQL database) without changing the high-level logic. This abstraction also allows for easier unit testing by mocking dependencies.




**Next Goals to Improve This Application:**

- Introduce a NoSQL database for data storage (this might be implemented in this project or a separate one for another course)
- Implement Redis for caching
